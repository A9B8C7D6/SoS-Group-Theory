# SoS-Group-Theory
Summer of Science content for my course on Group Theory

This repo consists of 2 pdfs and a beamer slide, the pdfs was all that I learnt about Group Theory, the way I understood it (pretty mathematically heavy) with one being a midterm report and the other an endterm report. The beamer was part of a short video I had made on how to prove Euler's Totient Theorem using Lagrange's Theorem and Group Theory in general.
